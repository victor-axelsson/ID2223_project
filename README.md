# TLDR 
This application does parsing of MIDI files into text files that can be used by a neural network

And theeen:

- unzip it

# Resources
Another good source of information is the MIDI specification on github: `https://github.com/colxi/midi-parser-js/wiki/MIDI-File-Format-Specifications`. This is the specification that I have worked with for this application.
